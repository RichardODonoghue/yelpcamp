# yelpcamp
YelpCamp is a website where users can create and review campgrounds. In order to review or create a campground, you must have an account. This project was part of Colt Steele's web dev course on udemy. This project was created using Node. js, Express, MongoDB (Atlas), Mapbox and Bootstrap. This is my version from the course which uses updated packages. I plan to add extra features to it as time allows. 

The project was deployed to Heroku, feel free to take a look. https://pacific-ocean-60530.herokuapp.com/
